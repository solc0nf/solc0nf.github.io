Attackers can issue commands remotely on the target host with elevated privileges, resulting in complete takeover of the system.
Let us have a look at what environment variables are.
Environment variables are the variables specific to a certain environment, like a root user would have different environment variables than a normal user in a Linux system.</description>

      <description>EternalBlue is the name given to a series of Microsoft software vulnerabilities, as well as an exploit developed by the Unites State&amp;rsquo;s NSA, as a cyber attack tool. Although the EternalBlue exploit affects only Windows operating systems, anything that uses the SMBv1 file sharing protocol is vulnerable to attack, such as Siemens ultrasound medical equipment.
EternalBlue was developed the NSA as a part of their controversial program of stockpiling and weaponizing cybersecurity vulnerabilities, rather that flagging those to the appropriate vendor for remediation.</description>
