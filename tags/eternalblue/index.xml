      <description>EternalBlue is the name given to a series of Microsoft software vulnerabilities, as well as an exploit developed by the Unites State&amp;rsquo;s NSA, as a cyber attack tool. Although the EternalBlue exploit affects only Windows operating systems, anything that uses the SMBv1 file sharing protocol is vulnerable to attack, such as Siemens ultrasound medical equipment.
EternalBlue was developed the NSA as a part of their controversial program of stockpiling and weaponizing cybersecurity vulnerabilities, rather that flagging those to the appropriate vendor for remediation.</description>
